# unifi

Ubiquiti Network's Unifi Controller

**This chart is not maintained by the [upstream project](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker) and any issues with the chart should be raised [here](https://github.com/mkilchhofer/unifi-chart/issues/new)**

{{ template "chart.sourcesSection" . }}

## Requirements

- Helm: 3.8+ (due to OCI registry support)
- {{ template "chart.kubeVersionLine" . }}

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `unifi`

```console
helm install unifi oci://ghcr.io/mkilchhofer/unifi-chart/unifi
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `unifi` deployment

```console
helm uninstall unifi
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](../common/values.yaml) from the [common library](../common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install unifi \
  --set env.TZ="America/New York" \
  oci://ghcr.io/mkilchhofer/unifi-chart/unifi
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install unifi oci://ghcr.io/mkilchhofer/unifi-chart/unifi -f values.yaml
```

## Custom configuration

### Regarding the services

- `guiService`: Represents the main web UI and is what one would normally point
  the ingress to.
- `captivePortalService`: This service is used to allow the captive portal webpage
  to be accessible. It needs to be reachable by the clients connecting to your guest
  network.
- `controllerService`: This is needed in order for the unifi devices to talk to
  the controller and must be otherwise exposed to the network where the unifi
  devices run. If you run this as a `NodePort` (the default setting), make sure
  that there is an external load balancer that is directing traffic from port
  8080 to the `NodePort` for this service.
- `discoveryService`: This needs to be reachable by the unifi devices on the
  network similar to the controller `Service` but only during the discovery
  phase. This is a UDP service.
- `stunService`: Also used periodically by the unifi devices to communicate
  with the controller using UDP. See [this article][ubnt 3] and [this other
  article][ubnt 4] for more information.
- `syslogService`: Used to capture syslog from Unifi devices if the feature is
  enabled in the site configuration. This needs to be reachable by Unifi devices
  on port 5514/UDP.
- `speedtestService`: Used for mobile speedtest inside the UniFi Mobile app.
  This needs to be reachable by clients connecting to port 6789/TCP.

### Ingress and HTTPS

Unifi does [not support HTTP][unifi] so if you wish to use the guiService, you
need to ensure that you use a backend transport of HTTPS.

An example entry in `values.yaml` to achieve this is as follows:

```
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
```
